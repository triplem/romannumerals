TripLeM's RomanNumeral Implementation
=====================================

This is a rough try to implement the Roman Numerals Kata (found on http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals).

There is a tag (setup) set before any real implementation (well, a basic testcase was setup and also some projectstructure).
